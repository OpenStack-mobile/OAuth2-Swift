///
/// The authorization code grant type is used to obtain both access
/// tokens and refresh tokens and is optimized for confidential clients.
/// Since this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of
/// interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web
/// browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection)
/// from the authorization server.

    /// HTTP redirection response, or by other means available to it via the
    /// user-agent.
    ///
    /// For example, the client directs the user-agent to make the following
    /// HTTP request using TLS (with extra line breaks for display purposes
    /// only):

    /// an authorization decision (by asking the resource owner or by
    /// establishing approval via other means).
