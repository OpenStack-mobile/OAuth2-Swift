/// [4.2.  Implicit Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2)
/// 
/// The implicit grant type is used to obtain access tokens (it does not
/// support the issuance of refresh tokens) and is optimized for public
/// clients known to operate a particular redirection URI.  These clients
/// are typically implemented in a browser using a scripting language
/// such as JavaScript.
///
/// Since this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of
/// interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web
/// browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection)
/// from the authorization server.
///
/// Unlike the authorization code grant type, in which the client makes
/// separate requests for authorization and for an access token, the
/// client receives the access token as the result of the authorization
/// request.
///
/// The implicit grant type does not include client authentication, and
/// relies on the presence of the resource owner and the registration of
/// the redirection URI.  Because the access token is encoded into the
/// redirection URI, it may be exposed to the resource owner and other
/// applications residing on the same device.

    /// The authorization server MUST NOT issue a refresh token.
    ///
    /// For example, the authorization server redirects the user-agent by
    /// sending the following HTTP response:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    /// Location: http://example.com/cb#access_token=2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA&state=xyz&token_type=example&expires_in=3600
